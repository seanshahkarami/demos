# Demos

These are an assorted collection of programs and bits of code that
are interesting but don't really belong any particular place. Enjoy!

## Summary

### mooseheart.html
A quick attempt at writting a "screen saver" with HTML5 canvas. Open it
and click the canvas to go fullscreen.

### reggie.*
These are simple implementations of regular expression matchers
based on the Regular Expression Derivatives Revisited paper.

### spindemo.py
This was created as a short, live demo of an MCMC (Markov Chain-Monte Carlo)
method applied to a 2D Ising model. You can adjust the temperature of the
given material to see how it affects the magnetization of the material.
You can also see a clear phase transition if you lower the temperature
below a certain level. It's written using Numpy / Scipy / Matplotlib.
