# Demos

These are an assorted collection of programs and bits of code that
are interesting but don't really belong any particular place. Enjoy!

## Summary

### reggie.*
These are simple implementations of regular expression matchers
based on the Regular Expression Derivatives Revisited paper.

### spindemo.py
This was created as a short, live demo of an MCMC (Markov Chain
Monte Carlo) method applied to a 2D Ising model. It shows how
adjusting the temperature of the given material affects it's
magnetization and displays a clear phase transition. It's written
using Numpy / Scipy / Matplotlib.
